Android client application for receiving messages, video and
audio stream from a RaspberryPi server.

The application uses Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for notifications
from the server and a standard Android media player class to
receive the audio and video.

The application is current under development and extremely unstable.

To use the application, create class com.sourceauditor.sahomemonitor.GcmConstants.java
with the following content:
package com.sourceauditor.sahomemonitor;
public class GcmConstants {   
    public static final String SENDER_ID = "Sender_ID_from_Google_projects";  
    /**
     * This class only contains static constants.  It can not be instantiated
     */
    private GcmConstants() {       
    }
}

The Sender ID is obtained from Google API project as described here: http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html

Compile and deploy the application.

The application will register with GCM and the registration ID will be displayed in the UI.

This registration code needs to be manually entered into the server code (see the server side project for details).

The server side application can be found in the git project [TBD].
